00:56.323 --> 00:58.604
It's raining cats and dogs out there!

00:58.724 --> 01:00.443
I hope they make it back all right.

01:00.563 --> 01:02.622
Heads up! Andy's coming!

01:04.654 --> 01:06.126
Andy, time for dinner.

01:06.246 --> 01:07.619
Yes! I'm starving!

01:07.739 --> 01:08.864
Don't forget to wash your hands!

01:08.984 --> 01:10.176
Okay, Mom!

01:14.184 --> 01:15.589
-Do you see him?
-No.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.885
Well, he's done for.

01:17.005 --> 01:18.374
He'll be lost! Forever!

01:18.540 --> 01:20.256
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.072
The rest of you, stay put.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.435
-Bo!
-Situation?

01:45.745 --> 01:47.172
Lost toy. Side yard.

01:47.292 --> 01:49.643
Billy. Goat. Gruff. Raise the blinds.

01:50.698 --> 01:52.643
They have names?
You never told me that.

01:52.803 --> 01:54.113
You never asked.

01:54.971 --> 01:56.123
Where is he?

01:57.428 --> 01:57.938
There!

01:58.058 --> 01:59.349
How do we reach him?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.003
Operation Pull-Toy!

02:01.203 --> 02:02.643
-Slink!
-You got it, Woody!

02:02.803 --> 02:04.283
Barbies!

02:11.883 --> 02:12.723
Go!

02:19.203 --> 02:20.243
Flashlight.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.363
Hang on, R.C.!

02:46.619 --> 02:49.006
I ain't got any more slink!

03:26.754 --> 03:28.083
It's beautiful.

03:28.243 --> 03:30.603
I'm so glad to see
this old lamp go to a good home.

03:30.763 --> 03:32.591
We've had it since Molly was a baby.

03:33.816 --> 03:35.123
Molly, are you sure it's all right?

03:35.283 --> 03:36.690
Yeah, I don't want it anymore.

03:36.810 --> 03:38.083
Thank you.

03:45.089 --> 03:46.383
Where's Woody?

03:54.643 --> 03:56.883
Yeah, hi. I think I left my keys here.

03:58.452 --> 03:59.203
-Woody.
-Quick!

03:59.363 --> 04:01.003
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.

04:01.123 --> 04:03.003
Woody, it's okay.

04:03.203 --> 04:05.488
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!

04:05.608 --> 04:07.490
- What's best for Andy is that...
- Woody.

04:07.965 --> 04:09.603
I'm not Andy's toy.

04:10.403 --> 04:11.556
What?

04:11.676 --> 04:13.763
It's time for the next kid.

04:13.923 --> 04:16.603
And thank you again for everything.
I really appreciate it.

04:16.763 --> 04:19.155
My pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.

04:21.126 --> 04:24.708
You know,
kids lose their toys every day.

04:26.143 --> 04:28.414
Sometimes they get left in the yard...

04:29.003 --> 04:31.083
or put in the wrong box.

04:36.243 --> 04:39.595
And that box gets taken away.

04:47.479 --> 04:48.669
Mom, where's Woody?

04:48.846 --> 04:50.203
Andy! Come inside!

04:50.363 --> 04:51.902
I can't find Woody!

05:12.962 --> 05:13.763
Well, good night.

05:13.923 --> 05:15.763
Goodbye.
Drive safe.

05:36.123 --> 05:37.815
There you are.

05:37.998 --> 05:39.643
Mom, I found him! I found him!

05:39.803 --> 05:42.563
Good.
Come on and get inside.

06:04.616 --> 06:06.688
You've got a friend in me

06:06.808 --> 06:08.803
Reach for the sky!

06:08.963 --> 06:11.483
You've got a friend in me

06:13.083 --> 06:16.915
- Ride 'em, cowboy! Yee-haw!
- When the road looks rough ahead

06:17.035 --> 06:18.523
-There's a snake in my boot.
-And you're miles and miles

06:18.643 --> 06:21.200
from your nice warm bed

06:21.405 --> 06:24.683
You just remember
what your old pal said

06:24.843 --> 06:28.363
-Boy, you've got a friend in me
-To infinity and beyond!

06:29.083 --> 06:32.323
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

06:34.025 --> 06:35.283
My cowboy!

06:35.443 --> 06:37.963
Now, some other folks might
be a little bit smarter than I am

06:38.083 --> 06:39.283
Big and stronger, too

06:39.443 --> 06:41.003
Woody, let's go!

06:41.123 --> 06:42.203
Maybe

06:42.363 --> 06:44.283
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

06:44.403 --> 06:47.731
You're my favorite deputy!

06:48.134 --> 06:50.241
It's me and you, boy

06:50.361 --> 06:53.294
And as the years go by

06:53.883 --> 06:55.123
Our friendship will never die

06:55.243 --> 06:57.101
Reach for the sky!

06:58.523 --> 06:59.923
You're gonna see it's our destiny

07:00.123 --> 07:02.970
They've escaped
and they're headed right for us!

07:03.443 --> 07:05.963
You've got a friend in me

07:07.603 --> 07:10.682
-Full speed ahead! Yay!
-You've got a friend in me

07:11.741 --> 07:14.772
You've got a friend in me

07:26.563 --> 07:27.923
It's getting hot in here!

07:28.123 --> 07:29.723
-Where's my ear?
-You're on my foot!

07:29.883 --> 07:31.003
-Hey, quit shoving.
-Sorry!

07:31.123 --> 07:33.243
-Could you move over a bit, please?
-That was my horn.

07:34.643 --> 07:35.763
To infinity and beyond!

07:35.923 --> 07:37.606
I know that was you, Potato Head.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.814
Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you...

07:39.934 --> 07:42.286
when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...

07:42.406 --> 07:44.152
expect to be put in the closet.

07:44.523 --> 07:45.688
How much longer?

07:45.876 --> 07:47.364
Keep it to a dull roar, Rex.

07:47.536 --> 07:49.063
Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths.

07:49.290 --> 07:51.607
Settle down, Slink. Sit.
Good boy!

07:51.727 --> 07:52.983
Sheriff, do I need to be worried?

07:53.103 --> 07:55.072
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.

07:55.192 --> 07:57.143
Good.
Just keep them calm until we get word.

07:57.343 --> 07:58.343
Yes, ma'am.

08:01.636 --> 08:03.463
How are you feeling about today?

08:03.623 --> 08:05.903
Good, good. Yeah, good.

08:06.063 --> 08:07.143
I'm good.

08:08.346 --> 08:09.389
Good.

08:11.136 --> 08:12.903
We're on!
Bonnie's done with breakfast!

08:13.063 --> 08:14.595
-Any minute now.
-You hear that?

08:14.715 --> 08:15.912
Any minute now.

08:16.032 --> 08:17.035
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

08:17.155 --> 08:18.823
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...

08:18.983 --> 08:19.983
Thanks, Woody.
I got it.

08:20.143 --> 08:22.423
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.

08:23.623 --> 08:26.063
The town is open!

08:26.223 --> 08:27.223
Hi, Mayor!

08:27.426 --> 08:28.162
Banker!

08:28.282 --> 08:30.509
Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!

08:30.629 --> 08:31.383
Mailman!

08:31.543 --> 08:33.103
And the sheriff!

08:33.863 --> 08:35.783
Okay. Bye, toys!

08:35.943 --> 08:38.012
Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!

08:38.132 --> 08:40.513
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

08:45.503 --> 08:46.783
They went that way!

08:46.943 --> 08:48.630
Chase them!

08:51.463 --> 08:53.523
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...

08:53.701 --> 08:55.703
Wow. They're doing "hat shop."

08:55.927 --> 08:58.005
When's the last time
we ever got to play that?

08:58.125 --> 08:59.585
Remember when she played "house"?

08:59.705 --> 09:00.489
I liked "house."

09:00.609 --> 09:01.863
Those were the days.

09:02.023 --> 09:04.832
It was basic. You made a house,
you lived in it, done.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.711
That's the third time you
haven't been picked this week.

09:07.831 --> 09:09.387
I don't know. I don't keep count.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.823
You don't have to.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.001
-I'll do it for you.
-Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.198
It's been a while.

09:14.318 --> 09:16.854
Looky there.
You got your first dust bunny.

09:17.263 --> 09:18.823
Aw, how adorable.

09:18.983 --> 09:20.023
What you gonna name it?

09:20.183 --> 09:21.183
What about Dusty?

09:21.303 --> 09:22.320
-Francis!
-Harry!

09:22.440 --> 09:23.423
-Karen!
-Fuzzball!

09:23.583 --> 09:24.458
-LeBron?
-No, Fluffy.

09:24.578 --> 09:26.076
-How about Thumper?
-Tumbleweed!

09:26.196 --> 09:27.876
"Tumbleweed."
Oh, that's good. That's good.

09:27.996 --> 09:30.562
He's a cowboy,
so that makes a lot of sense.

09:30.682 --> 09:32.023
So many choices.

09:32.183 --> 09:33.423
I just can't decide!

09:33.583 --> 09:36.044
Bonnie? What are you doing?
We gotta go.

09:36.164 --> 09:38.323
You don't wanna be late
for kindergarten orientation, do you?

09:38.443 --> 09:41.085
But I don't wanna go.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.182
We talked about this.

09:42.302 --> 09:43.901
We're gonna meet your teachers,
see your classroom...

09:44.021 --> 09:45.341
Can I bring a toy?

09:45.541 --> 09:48.261
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.

09:52.421 --> 09:53.533
Freeze! Nobody move!

09:53.699 --> 09:55.021
Bonnie always forgets something.

09:55.181 --> 09:56.421
She'll be back any second.

09:56.621 --> 09:57.821
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

09:57.981 --> 09:58.981
But it's money!

09:59.861 --> 10:01.941
You all right, Woody?
I'm sure she'll pick you next time.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.101
Come on, I'm fine.
No problem.

10:04.261 --> 10:05.261
Hey, Woody. Here.

10:05.421 --> 10:06.414
Thanks, Jessie.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.301
We're here for you, buddy.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.661
-I don't want to play the baker.
-Pricklepants.

10:10.821 --> 10:13.261
The hat shop owner
is the role I was born to play!

10:13.421 --> 10:14.821
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.

10:14.981 --> 10:15.629
Excuse me, Dolly?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.381
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?

10:17.581 --> 10:19.541
-Go back to the closet.
-Yeah, I know, I know. It's just...

10:19.701 --> 10:22.741
I'm worried about Bonnie. A
toy should go with her to orientation.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.861
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

10:25.021 --> 10:26.701
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.

10:26.821 --> 10:28.501
It can be too much for a kid.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.741
Having a buddy with them to
get through it can really help things.

10:30.901 --> 10:32.581
I remember with Andy,
I would go to school with him...

10:32.741 --> 10:34.781
I'm sorry, Woody, I hate
to sound like a broken record...

10:34.941 --> 10:36.221
but Bonnie's not Andy.

10:36.381 --> 10:37.781
No, no, no, of course, I get that.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.141
But if you would just...

10:39.301 --> 10:41.051
Places, everyone!

10:54.501 --> 10:55.701
Bonnie?

10:56.381 --> 10:57.981
What are you doing back there?

10:58.330 --> 10:59.904
Come on, we have to go.

11:02.587 --> 11:04.164
That's my big girl.

11:04.284 --> 11:06.804
Come on. We gotta hurry, okay?

11:07.564 --> 11:09.564
Don't forget your backpack.

11:09.764 --> 11:12.324
You're gonna have so much fun.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.884
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?

11:17.804 --> 11:19.204
Woody?

11:26.663 --> 11:28.364
Here we are.

11:44.749 --> 11:46.786
Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.823
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

11:49.372 --> 11:52.517
My name is Miss Wendy. I'm
going to be your kindergarten teacher.

11:54.564 --> 11:57.547
We have a special place
where you can put your backpack.

11:57.764 --> 11:59.364
You want to see?

12:18.965 --> 12:21.031
Here we are, Bonnie. Just for you.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.844
Okay, class,
let's all find a seat at a table...

12:24.004 --> 12:26.204
so we can start craft time.

12:26.364 --> 12:29.764
On the first day of school, you'll
need a place to put your pencils.

12:29.924 --> 12:33.489
So, today,
we're going to make pencil holders.

12:33.716 --> 12:35.437
Now, everyone take a cup...

12:35.557 --> 12:38.844
and we'll use the art supplies
to decorate them.

12:40.404 --> 12:41.989
Hi.

14:08.284 --> 14:11.374
Bonnie. That is so clever.

14:11.844 --> 14:13.964
"Hello, I'm Forky. Nice to meet you!"

14:14.124 --> 14:15.844
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.

14:16.004 --> 14:17.324
I'm Miss Wendy.

14:20.164 --> 14:22.381
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!

14:22.564 --> 14:23.684
His name is Forky!

14:23.844 --> 14:25.084
-Wow!
-That is so cool!

14:25.244 --> 14:27.278
I finished kindergarten!

14:28.685 --> 14:31.151
No. That was just orientation.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.958
But for being such a brave girl,
we have a surprise for you.

14:34.135 --> 14:34.883
What is it?

14:35.003 --> 14:38.684
Since school doesn't start for another
week, we are going on a road trip!

14:38.844 --> 14:40.684
-Can I bring Forky?
-'Course you can!

14:40.844 --> 14:42.164
Yay!

14:47.164 --> 14:50.164
And they said I shouldn't go to school
with Bonnie.

14:50.896 --> 14:53.492
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?

14:53.804 --> 14:56.582
I can't believe I'm
talking to a spork.

15:05.294 --> 15:07.052
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!

15:12.964 --> 15:14.724
-He did go to kindergarten!
-I knew it.

15:14.884 --> 15:16.762
-No, no, no, guys, listen...
-You tryin' to get Bonnie in trouble?

15:16.882 --> 15:17.844
No, of course not!

15:18.004 --> 15:19.281
You could have been confiscated.

15:19.401 --> 15:21.271
-What does that mean?
-Taken away.

15:21.391 --> 15:22.285
-No!
-Or worse.

15:22.446 --> 15:23.446
You could've been lost!

15:23.606 --> 15:24.728
No, no, no, guys, listen.

15:24.848 --> 15:26.487
Bonnie had a great day in class...

15:26.607 --> 15:27.928
and we're going on a road trip.

15:28.048 --> 15:29.166
-Road trip?
-Vacation!

15:29.326 --> 15:30.151
Yee-haw!

15:30.271 --> 15:32.206
But then something
really weird happened.

15:32.452 --> 15:34.052
Bonnie made a friend in class.

15:34.212 --> 15:36.171
-What a kid.
-She's already making friends.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.372
No, no. She literally
made a new friend.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.672
Hey, it's okay.

15:41.792 --> 15:43.612
Come on out. That's it.

15:44.172 --> 15:46.081
Come on, there you go.

15:47.972 --> 15:49.976
Come on, let's get you out of there.

15:50.096 --> 15:51.399
You got this.

15:51.519 --> 15:53.292
Good. Good.

15:53.498 --> 15:56.578
Everyone, I want you to meet Forky.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.258
-Golly bob howdy!
-Look at that!

15:58.418 --> 16:00.658
Look how long his arms are!

16:00.818 --> 16:02.418
-Trash?
-No.

16:02.578 --> 16:04.458
No, toys.

16:04.618 --> 16:06.538
They're all toys.

16:08.418 --> 16:09.778
-Trash?
-No, no, no.

16:09.981 --> 16:11.938
That's the trash.

16:12.098 --> 16:13.258
These are your friends.

16:13.418 --> 16:14.721
Hi!

16:15.338 --> 16:16.498
Trash!

16:16.658 --> 16:17.698
-No, no, it's okay.
-Trash!

16:17.858 --> 16:19.384
Woody, I have a question.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.098
Well, actually, not just one,
I have all of them.

16:22.218 --> 16:23.778
I have all the questions.

16:23.978 --> 16:25.521
Why does he want to go to the trash?

16:25.641 --> 16:27.498
-Because he was made from trash.
-Trash!

16:27.618 --> 16:30.418
Look, I know this is a little strange,
but you gotta trust me on this.

16:30.578 --> 16:31.127
Trash?

16:31.247 --> 16:35.440
Forky is the most important toy
to Bonnie right now.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.418
Important?

16:36.538 --> 16:37.247
He's a spork.

16:37.451 --> 16:39.458
Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork...

16:39.618 --> 16:43.740
this toy is crucial to Bonnie
getting adjusted to kindergarten.

16:44.154 --> 16:46.378
Woody, aren't you being
a little dramatic about all this?

16:46.538 --> 16:47.938
I know this is new to everybody...

16:48.098 --> 16:50.898
but you should see how much
this little guy means to Bonnie.

16:51.018 --> 16:53.498
When she started playing with him...

16:53.658 --> 16:55.698
she had the biggest smile on her face.

16:55.858 --> 16:57.058
I wish you could have seen it.

16:57.218 --> 16:58.258
Bonnie was really upset...

16:58.378 --> 16:59.978
and I swear,
once she made Forky...

17:00.138 --> 17:01.698
it was a complete transformation.

17:01.858 --> 17:02.702
Woody?

17:02.822 --> 17:03.761
Just a second, Jessie.

17:03.881 --> 17:07.889
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.744
Something happened to him.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.896
Chutes and Ladders!

17:13.016 --> 17:13.658
Trash.

17:13.818 --> 17:14.777
-No, no, no!
-No! No!

17:14.897 --> 17:16.218
You're a toy now, Forky!
Come on!

17:16.378 --> 17:17.378
Stop! Stop it!

17:17.538 --> 17:18.938
-Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
-Trash!

17:19.058 --> 17:20.178
Trash! Trash!

17:20.338 --> 17:24.218
Well, I guess I'll just babysit him
till he's used to the room.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.520
Forky?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.360
Where are you, Forky?

17:35.040 --> 17:36.120
There you are!

17:36.280 --> 17:38.240
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

17:52.034 --> 17:54.440
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!

17:54.600 --> 17:57.160
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.080
She loves you and you need to...

18:16.840 --> 18:18.240
Forky?

18:20.937 --> 18:22.378
Bonnie!

18:22.846 --> 18:23.732
Let's go!

18:23.920 --> 18:25.403
Rise and shine!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.800
Who wants to go on a road trip?

18:27.960 --> 18:30.400
Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly,
and Buttercup...

18:30.560 --> 18:32.400
and Forky, and...

18:32.632 --> 18:34.720
Forky? Where are you?

18:34.840 --> 18:37.347
-He's gotta be here somewhere.
-Forky?

18:37.960 --> 18:38.960
Forky!

18:39.160 --> 18:41.640
Come on. Let's eat some breakfast
and hit the road!

18:41.800 --> 18:43.360
Let's go, Forky!

18:48.320 --> 18:49.520
He's quite a handful, Woody.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.444
You need help with
him on the road trip?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.520
No. No, no. I got it, I got it.

18:54.138 --> 18:56.200
We'll just be stuck in an RV.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.160
He can't get far.
I got this.

18:58.443 --> 18:59.760
I got it.

19:03.849 --> 19:05.640
I can't let you

19:06.122 --> 19:07.725
I can't let you

19:08.400 --> 19:11.640
I can't let you throw yourself away

19:12.878 --> 19:15.065
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

19:15.185 --> 19:17.320
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

19:17.480 --> 19:19.440
I can't let you throw yourself away

19:21.840 --> 19:25.160
Don't you want to see
the sun come up each morning?

19:25.680 --> 19:26.452
No, no!

19:26.619 --> 19:29.480
Don't you want to see
the sun go down each day?

19:31.413 --> 19:35.160
Don't you want to see
that little girl that loves you so?

19:35.320 --> 19:36.880
Her heart would break

19:37.080 --> 19:37.895
Yeah!

19:38.015 --> 19:39.600
If you should go

19:40.416 --> 19:42.560
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

19:42.720 --> 19:44.840
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

19:44.960 --> 19:45.952
I can't let you throw yourself away

19:46.072 --> 19:47.618
No, no, no!

19:48.236 --> 19:48.951
No! No! No!

19:49.160 --> 19:52.800
So it seems to me like
you're never gonna behave yourself

19:53.686 --> 19:56.997
Since I'm not gonna do this every day

19:59.072 --> 20:02.760
Come tomorrow,
you're gonna have to save yourself

20:02.920 --> 20:04.880
Got nothing more to say

20:05.000 --> 20:07.720
You're not listening anyway

20:07.880 --> 20:09.840
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

20:10.040 --> 20:12.240
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

20:12.400 --> 20:14.240
-Trash, here I come!
-I can't let you throw yourself away

20:14.400 --> 20:15.946
Come on.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.440
I can't let you

20:19.046 --> 20:20.498
I can't let you

20:21.272 --> 20:22.280
I can't let you throw yourself away

20:22.400 --> 20:24.480
I don't wanna be a toy!

20:25.684 --> 20:27.880
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

20:28.000 --> 20:30.120
-I can't let you
-I can't let you

20:30.280 --> 20:33.457
I can't let you throw yourself away

20:58.370 --> 20:59.339
Hey, buddy.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.739
Hey, Buzz.

21:01.259 --> 21:02.459
You doing okay?

21:02.799 --> 21:04.073
I don't know, Buzz.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.979
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...

21:07.513 --> 21:10.169
but I don't remember
it being this hard.

21:11.459 --> 21:13.939
Want me to take the next watch?
I'll keep an eye on Forky.

21:14.059 --> 21:15.963
No, no. I need to do this.

21:16.083 --> 21:19.242
That little voice inside me would
never leave me alone if I gave up.

21:22.053 --> 21:23.699
Who do you think it is?

21:23.859 --> 21:24.569
Who?

21:24.689 --> 21:27.321
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?

21:29.723 --> 21:30.859
Me.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.841
You know, my conscience?

21:34.859 --> 21:37.597
That part of you
that tells you things?

21:37.717 --> 21:38.986
What you're really thinking?

21:40.141 --> 21:41.459
Fascinating.

21:41.619 --> 21:44.339
So, your inner voice advises you.

21:44.499 --> 21:45.499
What?

21:47.419 --> 21:50.419
It's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

21:54.357 --> 21:55.685
Where's Forky?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.219
Oh, no!
Forky!

21:59.193 --> 22:00.344
Forky!

22:00.510 --> 22:01.884
I am not a toy!

22:02.004 --> 22:02.939
I'm a spork.

22:03.099 --> 22:03.621
Be quiet!

22:03.741 --> 22:05.281
I was made for soup, salad...

22:05.401 --> 22:07.779
maybe chili,
and then the trash.

22:08.092 --> 22:09.402
I'm litter!

22:09.522 --> 22:11.161
Freedom!

22:13.259 --> 22:14.819
Hamm, how far to our next stop?

22:14.979 --> 22:16.797
5.32 miles, give or take.

22:16.917 --> 22:17.819
I can make that.

22:17.979 --> 22:19.259
I'll meet you at the RV park.

22:19.419 --> 22:21.259
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!

22:39.774 --> 22:41.176
Forky!

22:42.407 --> 22:44.619
Forky, where are you?

22:44.992 --> 22:46.416
Forky!

22:46.615 --> 22:48.152
Forky, where are you?

23:06.014 --> 23:07.734
-Carry me?
-No.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.134
Why do I have to be a toy?

23:10.254 --> 23:12.869
Because you have Bonnie's name
written on the bottom of your sticks.

23:12.989 --> 23:15.654
Why do I have Bonnie's name
written on the bottom of my sticks?

23:15.774 --> 23:17.254
Because she...

23:18.909 --> 23:22.944
Look, she plays with
you all the time, right?

23:23.188 --> 23:23.625
Yes.

23:23.814 --> 23:25.873
And who does she
sleep with every night?

23:26.044 --> 23:27.196
The big white fluffy thing?

23:27.316 --> 23:28.854
No, not her pillow.

23:29.014 --> 23:30.254
You.

23:31.174 --> 23:31.994
All right, Forky.

23:32.182 --> 23:35.894
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.

23:36.054 --> 23:37.372
You're Bonnie's toy.

23:37.492 --> 23:39.614
You are going to help create
happy memories...

23:39.774 --> 23:42.451
that will last for
the rest of her life.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.542
Huh? What?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.193
Okay. Doing it for Bonnie.

23:48.313 --> 23:50.519
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.774
Okay, like it or not, you are a toy.

23:53.894 --> 23:56.814
Maybe you don't like being one,
but you are one nonetheless.

23:56.974 --> 23:59.104
Which means you are going
to be there for Andy when he...

23:59.224 --> 24:00.532
Who's Andy?

24:01.694 --> 24:02.563
I mean, Bonnie.

24:02.683 --> 24:04.290
You have to be there for Bonnie.

24:04.494 --> 24:06.183
That is your job.

24:06.494 --> 24:07.556
Well, what's your job?

24:07.744 --> 24:10.210
Well, right now,
it's to make sure you do yours.

24:10.330 --> 24:11.854
-Carry me?
-No!

24:17.991 --> 24:19.319
Who's Andy?

24:21.069 --> 24:22.814
Andy was my other kid.

24:23.566 --> 24:25.174
You had another kid?

24:25.374 --> 24:26.374
Yeah, yeah.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.054
For a long time.

24:29.771 --> 24:31.254
And it was pretty great.

24:32.366 --> 24:34.334
I was a favorite toy, actually.

24:35.676 --> 24:37.654
Running the room was my job.

24:37.983 --> 24:39.174
Keeping all the toys in place...

24:39.294 --> 24:42.054
So, he thought Andy's
room was a planet?

24:42.214 --> 24:44.044
Wow, that is messed up.

24:44.164 --> 24:44.579
Right!

24:44.699 --> 24:46.528
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.

24:46.648 --> 24:49.186
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?

24:49.306 --> 24:51.374
-Thank you!
-Seriously, that is the...

24:51.534 --> 24:55.134
Well, then you watch 'em grow up
and become a full person.

24:57.094 --> 24:58.694
And then they leave.

24:59.038 --> 25:01.368
They go off and do
things you'll never see.

25:03.605 --> 25:06.094
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.270
But then somehow you find yourself,
after all those years...

25:09.390 --> 25:12.669
sitting in a closet just feeling...

25:12.789 --> 25:14.134
Useless?

25:15.474 --> 25:16.414
Yeah.

25:16.574 --> 25:18.454
Your purpose fulfilled?

25:19.005 --> 25:20.306
Exactly.

25:20.566 --> 25:22.414
Woody, I know what your problem is.

25:22.574 --> 25:23.267
You do?

25:23.387 --> 25:25.014
You're just like me.

25:25.174 --> 25:26.214
Trash!

25:26.334 --> 25:27.974
What is it with you and trash?

25:28.134 --> 25:29.574
-It's warm.
-Ew.

25:29.734 --> 25:30.871
-It's cozy.
-I guess.

25:30.991 --> 25:31.829
And safe!

25:31.949 --> 25:35.770
Like somebody's whispering in your
ear, "Everything's gonna be okay."

25:35.890 --> 25:37.854
Forky, that's it.

25:38.172 --> 25:40.935
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.

25:41.055 --> 25:42.801
-She does?
-Yes!

25:44.944 --> 25:46.095
Wait a sec.

25:47.473 --> 25:49.184
-You mean she thinks I'm warm?
-Yep.

25:49.304 --> 25:50.491
-And cozy?
-Uh-huh.

25:50.611 --> 25:51.814
And sometimes kinda squishy?

25:52.046 --> 25:53.442
Well, that, too. Yes.

25:53.611 --> 25:55.174
I get it now.

25:55.294 --> 25:56.286
I'm Bonnie's trash.

25:56.406 --> 25:57.260
Yes! Wait, what?

25:57.380 --> 25:58.837
I am Bonnie's trash!

25:58.957 --> 25:59.886
No, no, no, not exactly.

26:00.046 --> 26:02.769
She must be feeling awful without me.
Woody, we got to get going, she needs me!

26:02.933 --> 26:03.269
Yeah...

26:03.389 --> 26:04.704
Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

26:04.875 --> 26:05.991
Forky, slow down! Forky!

26:06.111 --> 26:07.406
Bonnie, I'm coming!

26:07.566 --> 26:08.566
Forky!

26:32.046 --> 26:34.562
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.

26:34.682 --> 26:35.479
Hurry!

26:57.446 --> 26:58.740
Woody?

27:03.893 --> 27:05.054
Bo?

27:13.748 --> 27:14.846
Woody?

27:19.420 --> 27:21.690
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

27:21.810 --> 27:24.202
I know, I know.
But my friend might be in there.

27:24.383 --> 27:25.326
Friend?

27:25.446 --> 27:26.926
A friend...

27:27.275 --> 27:28.440
Well, a friend is...

27:28.560 --> 27:30.400
Well, a friend is like you and me.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.126
Trash?

27:31.282 --> 27:32.286
Trash, like... Yes.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.202
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.

27:34.322 --> 27:36.246
But, Woody, Bonnie's right there.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.654
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.

27:48.601 --> 27:49.681
Bo?

27:50.074 --> 27:51.332
Bo?

27:53.042 --> 27:53.856
Bo?

27:53.976 --> 27:55.150
Bo?

27:56.561 --> 27:57.441
Bo?

27:57.945 --> 27:59.057
Bo?

27:59.340 --> 28:00.371
Bo?

28:00.491 --> 28:01.602
Bo.

28:01.775 --> 28:03.820
Bo, Bo, Bo...

28:05.707 --> 28:07.328
-Bo?
-Bo?

28:11.041 --> 28:12.385
Can we go back to Bonnie now?

28:12.505 --> 28:13.615
I don't see your friend.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.121
Yeah, okay.

28:15.281 --> 28:16.641
She's not in here.

28:16.801 --> 28:18.321
Come on, let's go.

28:29.401 --> 28:30.938
Is that Bo?

28:36.167 --> 28:37.521
Hey, howdy.

28:37.681 --> 28:38.965
Hey there.

28:39.085 --> 28:39.936
Sorry to bother you, but...

28:40.056 --> 28:42.201
Why, you're not a bother at all.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.447
We were just out
for my early morning stroll.

28:45.607 --> 28:46.819
And look...

28:46.939 --> 28:48.405
we met you!

28:48.604 --> 28:52.561
My name is Gabby Gabby. And
this is my very good friend Benson.

28:53.487 --> 28:54.681
Woody. Pleasure to meet you.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.670
Well, it's nice to meet you, Woody.
And you are...?

28:57.976 --> 28:58.941
This is Forky.

28:59.061 --> 29:00.121
I'm trash.

29:00.860 --> 29:01.750
Our kid made him.

29:01.932 --> 29:04.381
Kid? Toys around here don't have kids.

29:04.634 --> 29:05.811
Are you two lost?

29:06.019 --> 29:07.800
Lost? No, no.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.361
But we are looking for a lost toy.

29:10.481 --> 29:13.081
She's a figurine.
Used to be on that lamp in the window?

29:13.241 --> 29:14.455
Name's Bo Peep?

29:14.575 --> 29:15.284
Bo Peep?

29:15.452 --> 29:17.090
Oh, yes, I know Bo.

29:17.210 --> 29:17.761
You do?

29:17.921 --> 29:19.407
Hop on in. We'll take you to her.

29:19.527 --> 29:21.367
You don't have to do that.

29:21.487 --> 29:22.828
Well, okay.

29:24.289 --> 29:26.881
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.

29:28.983 --> 29:30.111
Wow, what service.

29:37.133 --> 29:39.418
Thank you for your help.
I haven't seen Bo in years.

29:39.538 --> 29:41.580
May I ask, when were you made?

29:41.779 --> 29:42.988
Me?

29:43.108 --> 29:44.949
I'm not sure. Late '50s?

29:45.069 --> 29:45.685
Me, too!

29:45.849 --> 29:47.903
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.

29:48.133 --> 29:49.743
Wouldn't that be something?

29:49.903 --> 29:52.069
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.

29:52.189 --> 29:55.258
Well, I try to stay active.

29:55.679 --> 29:58.230
And look at that,
you have a voice box like me.

29:58.350 --> 29:59.767
Benson, show him.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.349
That's really not necessary.

30:06.663 --> 30:09.863
I'm Gabby Gabby and I love you.

30:10.223 --> 30:12.023
Wow, you need to fix that.

30:13.149 --> 30:16.903
My record works just fine.
It's the voice box that's broken.

30:17.226 --> 30:18.357
Does yours still work?

30:18.592 --> 30:18.915
Hey!

30:19.035 --> 30:20.960
There's a snake in my boot!

30:21.137 --> 30:23.245
Listen to that!
Let's see it.

30:23.365 --> 30:24.426
I bet it's the same type.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.673
No, thanks, mine's sewn inside.

30:26.903 --> 30:28.466
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...

30:31.613 --> 30:33.322
The store is about to open.

30:33.442 --> 30:35.466
Don't worry, we'll take
you where no one will see us.

30:35.586 --> 30:37.619
Oh, no. We can't stay.

30:37.778 --> 30:39.208
Yes, you can.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.372
We gotta go.

30:51.492 --> 30:54.520
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.

30:54.821 --> 30:58.181
Right inside there.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.106
-Returned that lamp the next day.
-You're kidding me!

31:01.266 --> 31:03.066
Mom, can we go to the park now?

31:03.226 --> 31:04.266
Harmony!

31:06.894 --> 31:08.277
Stop him, please.

31:18.968 --> 31:20.066
What's going on?

31:22.010 --> 31:23.276
Come on! Let's go!

31:23.396 --> 31:25.226
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!

31:25.500 --> 31:27.386
Forky? We got to get out of...

31:27.683 --> 31:29.061
Woody!

31:35.546 --> 31:37.598
I'd like to join your posse, boys.

31:37.718 --> 31:40.051
But first,
I'm gonna sing a little song.

31:46.626 --> 31:48.388
Grandma, look what I found.

31:48.508 --> 31:50.350
-Can I take it to the park?
-Sure.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.154
Mom, she has enough
toys from the store.

31:53.315 --> 31:56.475
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.355
Thanks, Grandma!

32:00.475 --> 32:02.235
Yee-haw!

32:03.120 --> 32:04.955
Mom, can we go to the carnival?

32:05.075 --> 32:07.595
We're going to the park.
Maybe later, sweetie.

32:14.726 --> 32:15.930
Any sign of Woody?

32:16.050 --> 32:17.355
I don't see him!

32:19.552 --> 32:21.275
Maybe we should have
gone with the fork.

32:21.435 --> 32:22.762
The spoon is safer.

32:27.493 --> 32:28.675
Forky?

32:29.171 --> 32:30.677
Where's Forky?

32:31.085 --> 32:32.595
Mom! Dad!

32:32.755 --> 32:33.795
-What's wrong, honey?
-Are you okay?

32:33.915 --> 32:35.915
I can't find Forky! He's missing!

32:36.075 --> 32:37.475
Bonnie, it'll be all right.

32:37.635 --> 32:39.315
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.716
You know, if you don't find him,
you can make a new one.

32:41.836 --> 32:44.266
No! There's only one Forky!

32:45.002 --> 32:48.425
Let's go look outside.
Maybe he fell on the ground somewhere.

32:48.628 --> 32:50.067
Poor Bonnie.

32:50.187 --> 32:51.115
We're gonna find him, okay?

32:51.275 --> 32:53.715
We have to find him, Mom.
He needs me.

32:53.915 --> 32:54.835
Woody was right.

32:54.955 --> 32:56.902
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.

32:57.022 --> 32:58.132
Why isn't Woody back yet?

32:58.252 --> 32:59.435
Do you think he's lost?

32:59.555 --> 33:01.091
-Buzz, what do we do?
-What do we do, Buzz?

33:01.211 --> 33:02.840
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

33:03.022 --> 33:04.635
What do we do, Buzz?
Buzz!

33:04.797 --> 33:06.139
-Buzz.
-What would Woody do?

33:06.259 --> 33:07.955
Jump out of a moving vehicle.

33:08.115 --> 33:09.715
What would Woody do?

33:10.929 --> 33:13.675
It's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go!

33:13.886 --> 33:16.475
I think I have to go.

33:16.635 --> 33:18.115
-Where?
-Where you goin'? Why?

33:18.235 --> 33:19.515
-Should we all go? Are we going?
-And then what?

33:19.635 --> 33:20.991
No time to explain! Attack!

33:21.178 --> 33:22.528
No time to explain!

33:22.815 --> 33:23.660
-Oh, no!
-Buzz!

33:23.780 --> 33:26.419
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?

33:34.603 --> 33:36.955
Woody and Forky were last seen
on the highway.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.595
But where is the highway?

33:39.005 --> 33:40.763
The slingshot maneuver
is all we've got!

33:40.883 --> 33:42.397
Full speed ahead!

33:45.347 --> 33:46.715
Thanks, inner voice!

33:57.635 --> 33:59.144
The highway.

33:59.524 --> 34:00.915
On my way, Woody!

34:19.301 --> 34:20.376
Rad.

34:21.855 --> 34:23.235
Hey! Step right up!

34:23.395 --> 34:25.155
Put your money down!
Get yourself a real Buzz Lightyear!

34:25.315 --> 34:27.115
Hey! Hey!

34:32.595 --> 34:34.715
Harmony, honey. Sunscreen.

34:34.835 --> 34:35.915
Okay.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.155
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

34:46.435 --> 34:49.075
Okay. Antique store, antique store...

34:49.525 --> 34:50.871
That way!

35:08.715 --> 35:10.998
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?

35:11.555 --> 35:13.195
We got a busload of campers!

35:14.514 --> 35:15.386
Here they come!

35:15.576 --> 35:16.882
Playtime, baby!

35:29.675 --> 35:31.995
Oh, baby!
It's a good day to play, huh?

35:32.155 --> 35:33.275
Am I right?

35:46.677 --> 35:49.715
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?

35:50.675 --> 35:53.035
"Do you like riding horses?"

36:01.595 --> 36:03.235
Wanna play on the swings?

36:03.413 --> 36:04.515
Wait for me!

36:06.118 --> 36:07.066
Bo?

36:07.420 --> 36:08.315
Come on.

36:18.065 --> 36:18.635
Bo!

36:18.795 --> 36:20.411
I can't believe it's you!

36:20.531 --> 36:23.692
-Bo Peep!
-I never thought I'd see you again!

36:28.083 --> 36:29.690
-So, which kid is yours?
-Which one is yours?

36:29.947 --> 36:30.917
-None.
-No one.

36:31.090 --> 36:32.995
-Wait, you're a lost toy?
-You're a lost toy?

36:33.465 --> 36:34.665
-That's awful.
-That's great.

36:35.425 --> 36:37.168
I mean, awfully great...

36:37.367 --> 36:40.345
that you are lost out here.

36:40.505 --> 36:42.505
-Skunk, skunk, skunk!
-Watch out!

36:47.585 --> 36:49.143
I told you not to drive so fast.

36:49.263 --> 36:50.816
You almost ran him over.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.745
Hey, guys!

36:53.905 --> 36:55.105
Hold on there!

36:55.305 --> 36:57.246
Okay!
I missed you, too.

36:57.366 --> 37:00.145
If it isn't Bobby?
Gus?

37:00.895 --> 37:02.015
Lefty?

37:02.299 --> 37:03.437
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.262
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.

37:05.558 --> 37:07.582
-Girls.
-Girls! Of course!

37:08.525 --> 37:09.825
All right, all right.

37:09.945 --> 37:12.945
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?

37:13.105 --> 37:15.025
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.345
Hey! Nice find, girls.

37:17.505 --> 37:19.640
-Where did you get all this stuff?
-Here and there.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.677
You know,
some kids play rougher than others...

37:22.797 --> 37:24.028
so I try to be prepared.

37:24.148 --> 37:25.785
How long have you
been out on your own?

37:25.945 --> 37:27.810
Seven fantastic years!

37:27.974 --> 37:28.588
Seven?

37:28.708 --> 37:31.345
You would not believe
the things I've seen.

37:31.465 --> 37:32.494
No.

37:32.614 --> 37:33.746
-Gigs.
-Yo!

37:33.919 --> 37:35.905
Come on out.
There's someone I want you to meet.

37:36.345 --> 37:37.505
Be right down.

37:41.865 --> 37:44.059
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...

37:44.179 --> 37:45.512
Whoa! Who's this?

37:45.826 --> 37:47.625
You remember the rag
doll I told you about?

37:47.785 --> 37:48.736
-The cowboy?
-Yep!

37:48.856 --> 37:50.684
No way!

37:53.105 --> 37:55.025
-Don't stare.
-I'm totally staring.

37:55.457 --> 37:57.745
Woody, this is Giggle McDimples.

37:59.049 --> 37:59.992
Hi, Giggle.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.105
Whoa, you didn't tell me he was a cop.

38:02.305 --> 38:03.272
Howdy, Sheriff.

38:03.392 --> 38:06.802
Officer Giggle McDimples.
I run Pet Patrol for Mini-Opolis.

38:07.010 --> 38:07.993
Yeah, search and rescue.

38:08.113 --> 38:10.852
Ants, caterpillars,
miniature poodles, spiders.

38:10.972 --> 38:12.476
Carl! Where you headed?

38:12.596 --> 38:14.545
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

38:14.705 --> 38:15.991
at the playground on Main Street.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.779
Rumor has it they got two piñatas.

38:17.935 --> 38:20.264
-That could be 20 to 30 kids.
-Nice!

38:20.384 --> 38:23.080
Yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!

38:23.970 --> 38:24.829
You guys in?

38:24.949 --> 38:27.585
You bet!
Woody, you are gonna love this!

38:27.903 --> 38:29.545
No, I can't, sir.

38:29.705 --> 38:31.385
Bo, I need to get back to my kid.

38:31.545 --> 38:33.189
-What?
-You got a kid?

38:33.309 --> 38:33.985
Yeah.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.745
Way to beat the odds, soldier.

38:36.639 --> 38:38.135
Meet you at the playground, Peep.

38:38.255 --> 38:40.615
Combat Carl's got
a piñata party to crash.

38:40.779 --> 38:42.425
All right, move out.

38:44.065 --> 38:46.720
So, you're with a kid?

38:46.928 --> 38:47.785
It's not Andy, is it?

38:47.945 --> 38:49.865
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

38:50.024 --> 38:51.825
But he gave us to Bonnie.

38:51.985 --> 38:53.924
-You have a little girl?
-No way!

38:54.044 --> 38:55.616
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

38:55.736 --> 38:58.025
Her other toy is trapped in
this antique store, and I have to...

38:58.225 --> 38:59.945
Second Chance Antiques?

39:00.300 --> 39:01.385
We know that store.

39:01.545 --> 39:02.945
That's great. That is great!

39:03.105 --> 39:04.825
If you know the store,
you could really help me find him...

39:04.985 --> 39:05.771
No way.

39:05.934 --> 39:08.802
We wasted years there, just
sitting on the shelf, collecting dust.

39:08.922 --> 39:10.305
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

39:10.539 --> 39:13.785
But I don't have a choice.
I have to get that toy from Gabby.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.214
Steer clear of that weirdo.

39:15.334 --> 39:17.505
If I were you,
I'd cut my losses and go home.

39:17.665 --> 39:19.705
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

39:19.865 --> 39:22.065
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.745
No, no...

39:23.905 --> 39:27.785
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

39:29.014 --> 39:31.880
No. Sorry, girls.
Molly's not here.

39:32.058 --> 39:34.023
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.

39:34.143 --> 39:35.520
That was a long time ago.

39:35.697 --> 39:38.145
Bo's kid was something special.

39:38.345 --> 39:39.945
She was the cutest thing...

39:40.065 --> 39:41.978
but so afraid of the dark.

39:42.215 --> 39:43.505
It was just a phase.

39:43.625 --> 39:45.143
You weren't there in the beginning.

39:45.263 --> 39:47.025
Hearing Molly cry each night...

39:47.225 --> 39:49.345
it broke every toy's heart.

39:49.757 --> 39:52.785
And then,
Bo came into the room.

39:53.067 --> 39:56.745
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

39:57.070 --> 39:58.760
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.865
Who knew you were such a softy?

40:01.025 --> 40:04.465
And Molly would fall asleep
with her hand resting on Bo's feet.

40:04.625 --> 40:06.785
Okay! Okay. I get it.

40:08.425 --> 40:10.884
Bo, my kid really needs this toy.

40:11.698 --> 40:14.505
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.

40:16.334 --> 40:17.745
All right, all right.

40:17.905 --> 40:18.905
Thank you!

40:19.537 --> 40:20.762
-Thank you!
-All right.

40:20.938 --> 40:22.876
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!

40:25.465 --> 40:28.105
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.

40:49.511 --> 40:50.835
Hey, hey!

40:50.955 --> 40:52.705
Benson, are we finished?

40:53.850 --> 40:54.934
That feels great!

40:55.054 --> 40:56.636
Look at that! Good as new.

40:56.756 --> 40:59.641
Yeah. Thank you, Benson.

41:01.297 --> 41:03.487
So, when's Woody coming back?

41:03.607 --> 41:05.352
Like I said, soon.

41:05.518 --> 41:06.758
He won't forget about you.

41:06.918 --> 41:07.635
How do you know?

41:07.755 --> 41:10.072
You have your child's name
written on your feet.

41:11.005 --> 41:11.798
Sticks.

41:11.959 --> 41:14.061
That makes you a very important toy.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.199
That's exactly what Woody says.

41:16.798 --> 41:17.604
Interesting.

41:17.724 --> 41:18.998
Hi, Grandma! We're back!

41:19.158 --> 41:20.158
She's back.

41:21.678 --> 41:22.678
Who is she?

41:23.551 --> 41:24.798
Harmony.

41:24.958 --> 41:25.958
Wait a second...

41:26.078 --> 41:27.318
she took Woody.

41:27.580 --> 41:28.552
Did she lose him?

41:28.672 --> 41:32.033
No. My Harmony is perfect.

41:35.533 --> 41:37.597
Forky, it's tea time. It's tea time.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.158
-What is tea time?
-I'll show you.

41:43.318 --> 41:46.114
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.

41:52.436 --> 41:54.718
I've been practicing.
How do I look?

41:55.506 --> 41:57.234
A little higher.

41:57.668 --> 41:59.138
Stick out your pinky.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.838
Nice!

42:01.740 --> 42:02.798
Delicious!

42:02.958 --> 42:04.773
Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving.

42:04.893 --> 42:06.038
Come give me a hug.

42:06.198 --> 42:08.427
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

42:21.374 --> 42:23.438
When my voice box is fixed...

42:24.805 --> 42:26.745
I'll finally get my chance.

42:40.561 --> 42:42.109
Now, about our friend Woody.

42:42.229 --> 42:44.878
I wanna know everything about him.

42:44.998 --> 42:45.828
Yeah, Woody.

42:45.987 --> 42:48.094
I've known that guy my whole life.
Two days!

42:48.214 --> 42:50.399
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?

42:50.519 --> 42:52.509
He had this other kid, Andy.

42:52.629 --> 42:54.838
And you know what? I don't
think he's ever gotten over him.

43:06.692 --> 43:08.679
Hey, Lightyear.

43:08.894 --> 43:10.364
Hey, up here, Astro-boy.

43:10.484 --> 43:13.899
If you think you can just show up
and take our top prize spot...

43:14.019 --> 43:14.915
-you're wrong!
-Dead wrong!

43:15.035 --> 43:16.703
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...

43:16.823 --> 43:19.085
Cheat the system and get with a kid?
Yeah, we know.

43:19.205 --> 43:20.362
No, I need...

43:20.482 --> 43:22.678
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?

43:22.838 --> 43:24.878
-Join the club, pal.
-Yeah, join the club!

43:25.038 --> 43:26.379
Come on, help me get outta here.

43:26.499 --> 43:28.398
I'll help you. With my foot!

43:28.918 --> 43:29.958
Get him.

43:30.745 --> 43:31.622
Get him.

43:31.742 --> 43:32.826
Bunny, what are you doing?

43:33.051 --> 43:35.398
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.

43:35.768 --> 43:37.429
Sorry, Ducky.
I'm not a mind reader, you know.

43:37.549 --> 43:39.278
What's not to understand?

43:39.438 --> 43:40.327
You gonna make me say it?

43:40.512 --> 43:41.558
What?

43:42.190 --> 43:44.758
With these tiny legs,
I cannot reach without your help.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.666
Okay? This is what
I've been talking about, Bunny.

43:46.894 --> 43:49.215
You need to work on paying attention
and your listening skills.

43:50.742 --> 43:52.398
How you like that, cheater?

43:53.256 --> 43:54.181
Yeah!

43:55.565 --> 43:58.275
To infinity and my foot! Boom!

43:58.395 --> 44:00.791
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!

44:00.911 --> 44:01.557
Boom!

44:01.677 --> 44:02.997
How do I get out of here?

44:03.642 --> 44:04.858
This planet is toxic.

44:04.978 --> 44:06.845
Closing helmet to conserve oxygen.

44:06.965 --> 44:09.627
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!

44:10.316 --> 44:11.258
Let go of me!

44:11.378 --> 44:12.878
Get off of me!

44:14.478 --> 44:16.158
-So, that's what gravity feel like.
-Yeah, that's it.

44:16.318 --> 44:17.532
Hey, where you going?

44:18.998 --> 44:20.318
You better get over here, spaceman!

44:20.438 --> 44:21.850
Yeah, put us back up there!

44:21.970 --> 44:23.958
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!

44:24.118 --> 44:25.351
-I'm trying!
-Come on!

44:27.478 --> 44:29.380
Antique store, here we come!

44:29.500 --> 44:31.306
Bo, why do you ride around in a skunk?

44:31.465 --> 44:32.721
Skunk!

44:32.841 --> 44:33.959
A skunk!

44:34.838 --> 44:36.438
I get it. Smart.

44:36.558 --> 44:38.372
Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs!

44:44.464 --> 44:45.838
Why are you so bad at driving?

44:45.998 --> 44:47.267
You got six eyes.

44:48.145 --> 44:49.968
Thanks for the landing.

44:50.518 --> 44:52.076
Come on, follow me.

44:58.014 --> 44:58.525
I'm fine.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.728
-His face! That's hilarious.
-I'm fine. Don't worry.

45:00.848 --> 45:02.158
Happens all the time.

45:02.318 --> 45:03.244
Tape!

45:03.566 --> 45:04.619
Not a bad hiding spot.

45:04.739 --> 45:06.158
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.

45:06.318 --> 45:07.594
-We'll fix it later.
-10-4.

45:07.714 --> 45:09.186
This will be more fun.

45:09.306 --> 45:10.998
Let's get you to that store!

45:12.385 --> 45:14.558
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?

45:14.678 --> 45:15.995
-There's no deal.
-Uh-huh.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.470
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.

45:18.590 --> 45:20.518
-Giggle...
-Trust me. I've been there.

45:20.638 --> 45:22.699
You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.

45:22.819 --> 45:24.016
Here he comes!

45:24.612 --> 45:25.878
-Oh, man...
-What?

45:26.038 --> 45:27.093
No, not you.

45:27.213 --> 45:29.549
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.

45:29.669 --> 45:30.924
Heavy foot traffic at the entrance.

45:31.044 --> 45:33.861
-Easiest way in is the roof.
-The roof!

45:34.438 --> 45:36.438
Let's go antiquing.

45:40.318 --> 45:41.318
Hold on!

45:44.850 --> 45:46.198
How did you end up here?

45:46.358 --> 45:47.798
I thought you were
given to a new family.

45:47.958 --> 45:48.943
You know how it goes.

45:49.158 --> 45:52.798
Their little girl grew up
and didn't need me anymore, so...

45:53.088 --> 45:54.430
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.520
Who needs a kid's room...

45:56.683 --> 46:00.838
when you can have all of this?

46:13.318 --> 46:14.718
Whatcha looking at, Sheriff?

46:14.838 --> 46:15.975
What?

46:16.672 --> 46:18.151
That wasn't... No, nothing.

46:18.271 --> 46:21.020
I was looking at the store.
Right there.

46:21.175 --> 46:22.758
I was looking at the antique store.

46:22.918 --> 46:24.928
-Giggle, count us down.
-Five.

46:25.048 --> 46:25.918
-Countdown for what?
-Four.

46:26.078 --> 46:27.610
-You want to get to the store, don't you?
-Three. Two.

46:27.730 --> 46:28.573
One!

46:39.918 --> 46:41.918
The highway exit has to be somewhere.

46:42.078 --> 46:43.398
Where is it?

46:43.708 --> 46:45.638
Meteor shower! Look out!

46:46.631 --> 46:47.388
Woody?

46:47.784 --> 46:49.158
Good work, inner voice.

46:49.748 --> 46:51.873
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?

46:51.993 --> 46:54.198
Bonnie?
She's great.

46:54.358 --> 46:55.398
Jessie is loving it.

46:55.558 --> 46:56.558
Jessie's still with you?

46:56.678 --> 46:58.669
Yeah, the whole gang's still together.

46:58.789 --> 47:01.163
Well, I mean, most of us.

47:03.003 --> 47:03.812
What about Rex?

47:03.932 --> 47:06.038
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...

47:06.199 --> 47:07.878
-the Potato Heads...
-Buzz?

47:08.038 --> 47:09.118
Yeah, Buzz, too.

47:09.238 --> 47:12.078
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...

47:12.238 --> 47:13.878
-Bo Peep?
-Buzz!

47:13.998 --> 47:15.718
-My old moving buddy!
-Buzz?

47:15.878 --> 47:16.958
It's so good to see you!

47:17.078 --> 47:18.372
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

47:18.673 --> 47:20.230
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

47:21.070 --> 47:23.685
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

47:23.805 --> 47:25.238
-Three years!
-Three years!

47:25.398 --> 47:27.777
That's how long we've been
hanging up there waiting for a kid!

47:27.897 --> 47:28.878
Look, I'm sorry about that.

47:29.038 --> 47:31.247
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!

47:31.678 --> 47:32.632
Who are these guys?

47:32.752 --> 47:34.390
-Lightyear promised us a kid.
-You did what?

47:34.510 --> 47:35.918
I did not.

47:36.038 --> 47:37.692
-Hey! Wait a minute!
-Eat my plush!

47:37.812 --> 47:39.037
All right now, come on, stop it!

47:39.157 --> 47:39.763
Cut it out now!

47:39.883 --> 47:41.078
Come on, guys, break it up.

47:41.198 --> 47:42.492
Guys, I have a kid!

47:43.617 --> 47:44.353
You got a kid?

47:44.473 --> 47:45.667
Like a kid-kid?

47:45.787 --> 47:48.099
Like a human kid, not a baby goat?

47:48.219 --> 47:50.118
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.

47:50.278 --> 47:51.493
I'll take you to Bonnie.

47:51.613 --> 47:53.082
-We're gettin' a kid?
-Yes!

47:53.202 --> 47:54.038
We're gettin' a kid?

47:54.198 --> 47:56.163
-We're gonna get a kid
-Kid

47:56.283 --> 47:57.796
-We're getting a kid
-All right, let's go.

47:57.916 --> 47:59.148
-We gonna get something, oh
-We gonna uh, uh, uh

47:59.308 --> 48:01.468
-Where's Forky?
-Long story.

48:01.628 --> 48:04.416
-Kid, we get a kid
-Kid, kid, kid

48:04.588 --> 48:07.181
-We gonna kid
-We gonna kid, kid

48:08.846 --> 48:10.539
He's not anywhere.

48:11.302 --> 48:12.798
Forky's gone.

48:12.918 --> 48:14.542
Honey, I'm sorry.

48:14.662 --> 48:16.948
Okay. Let's look
outside one more time.

48:17.108 --> 48:19.748
But then we have
to keep driving, okay?

48:23.023 --> 48:24.348
They're about to leave!

48:24.508 --> 48:25.868
-Leaving?
-They can't do that!

48:26.028 --> 48:27.754
The panic is attacking me!

48:28.119 --> 48:30.068
-Hey! Watch it, buddy!
-What do we do?

48:30.228 --> 48:31.624
-We have to stop them!
-How?

48:31.744 --> 48:34.188
We could frame Dad
for a crime so he goes to jail.

48:34.348 --> 48:36.748
Or go back in time
and warn Woody about the future.

48:36.868 --> 48:39.068
-That's crazy. Time is a flat circle.
-Jessie!

48:43.211 --> 48:44.563
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

48:44.683 --> 48:46.748
We looked everywhere.
But we need to get going now, okay?

48:46.908 --> 48:48.345
Can we please leave
a note for Forky...

48:48.465 --> 48:49.926
so he knows where we're going?

48:50.046 --> 48:52.577
He has to go to kindergarten.

48:55.119 --> 48:57.293
Are you kidding me?
I can't...

48:57.957 --> 49:00.730
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.

49:01.047 --> 49:03.053
Okay! Daddy's going to use some words.

49:03.173 --> 49:04.696
How about we go to the carnival?

49:04.847 --> 49:07.188
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?

49:09.044 --> 49:09.821
What did you do?

49:09.941 --> 49:12.948
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.

49:13.068 --> 49:14.108
-Brilliant!
-That was genius!

49:14.268 --> 49:15.188
Nice work, Jessie!

49:15.348 --> 49:18.145
I'm sure Buzz and Woody
are on their way back right now.

49:22.407 --> 49:24.079
Forky is in there?

49:24.237 --> 49:24.773
Yeah.

49:24.893 --> 49:26.308
Now, hold on.
I have a question.

49:26.468 --> 49:29.148
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.

49:29.268 --> 49:30.096
-No, say Ducky. Ducky.
-Bunny. Bunny.

49:30.216 --> 49:31.789
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.

49:31.985 --> 49:33.285
You have to follow my lead.

49:33.405 --> 49:36.346
We stay together, we stay quiet.
Are we clear?

49:36.466 --> 49:37.908
Absolutely.
Lead the way.

49:59.747 --> 50:01.041
-Are you kidding me?
-Move over.

50:01.161 --> 50:02.551
-You move over.
-Quit pushing me.

50:02.706 --> 50:03.228
Stop.

50:03.681 --> 50:06.177
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has three heads!

50:06.332 --> 50:06.989
No, no, no!

50:07.109 --> 50:09.548
What?
All six eyes just looked into my soul.

50:09.668 --> 50:10.908
Gonna have nightmares.

50:15.828 --> 50:18.348
That's most likely where your Forky
is being kept.

50:19.228 --> 50:20.428
All right, this isn't so bad.

50:20.588 --> 50:22.498
We just can't be seen by the dummies.

50:22.618 --> 50:23.870
Not just the dummies.

50:23.990 --> 50:27.433
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.

50:27.609 --> 50:30.188
Where Dragon roams.

50:30.745 --> 50:32.152
-We can handle a cat.
-No.

50:32.272 --> 50:33.513
Not this one.

50:37.468 --> 50:40.107
Is that how we look on the inside?

50:40.227 --> 50:42.268
There's so much fluff.

50:42.388 --> 50:43.777
So, how do you propose
we get up there?

50:43.897 --> 50:45.788
We could go straight across.

50:46.068 --> 50:47.753
-How?
-That's quite a jump.

50:47.873 --> 50:49.668
We know the perfect toy to help.

50:49.828 --> 50:51.028
Bonnie, check it out.

50:51.188 --> 50:53.123
-Look at all this cool stuff.
-Bonnie?

50:53.281 --> 50:54.778
We gotta get Forky now!

50:54.898 --> 50:55.947
Woody, don't...

50:56.133 --> 50:57.508
-Stick to the plan.
-10-4.

50:57.628 --> 50:59.153
-Follow me.
-Roger that.

51:04.668 --> 51:07.002
Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?

51:07.122 --> 51:09.508
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.

51:09.628 --> 51:10.394
That's awful.

51:10.514 --> 51:12.408
Such pretty hair...

51:12.896 --> 51:13.988
What are you doing?

51:14.148 --> 51:15.228
You need to stick to the plan.

51:15.348 --> 51:16.828
But it's Bonnie. She's right...

51:16.989 --> 51:18.508
Can we go to the carnival, too?

51:18.739 --> 51:19.269
...there.

51:19.389 --> 51:21.748
Come on. Stay quiet.

51:21.908 --> 51:23.468
You better hope the dummies didn't...

52:02.428 --> 52:03.493
My sheep!

52:10.731 --> 52:12.846
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.

52:12.966 --> 52:15.637
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.
Just tell me how to help.

52:15.757 --> 52:16.588
You really wanna help?

52:16.708 --> 52:19.493
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.

52:19.613 --> 52:20.508
What about the others?

52:20.668 --> 52:22.148
Giggle knows what to do.

52:25.149 --> 52:27.228
-Here you go.
-That's our objective.

52:27.441 --> 52:29.268
We have to get that key.

52:29.388 --> 52:30.839
It's the only way inside the cabinet.

52:30.959 --> 52:33.508
You can't be serious.
How are we supposed to do that?

52:34.010 --> 52:34.814
Okay.

52:34.934 --> 52:36.281
You know what, leave that to us.

52:36.401 --> 52:38.430
We know exactly what to do.

52:41.775 --> 52:43.468
Where did you two come from?

52:43.628 --> 52:45.828
The keys! Give 'em up now!
Where are they?

52:45.948 --> 52:47.828
Give us the keys! Give us the keys!

52:48.164 --> 52:49.148
Well, we're not doing that.

52:49.308 --> 52:50.462
Yeah, yeah, I agree, too visible.

52:50.582 --> 52:52.075
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.

52:52.195 --> 52:53.657
What about
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner"?

52:53.808 --> 52:54.599
Yes.

53:00.753 --> 53:03.323
The keys! Give 'em up now!
Where are they?

53:04.007 --> 53:05.347
-You're kidding.
-Really?

53:05.509 --> 53:07.053
Okay, okay. You just...

53:07.214 --> 53:08.456
All right. Well...

53:08.576 --> 53:10.413
What about the old "Plush Rush"?

53:10.533 --> 53:11.654
There you go!

53:25.134 --> 53:26.854
-Where is this going?
-Don't interrupt.

53:42.378 --> 53:43.173
Okay, right?

53:43.324 --> 53:45.468
Not gonna happen.
N-O.

53:45.588 --> 53:47.666
Okay, do you want the key or not?

53:47.786 --> 53:48.402
What is wrong with you?

53:48.522 --> 53:49.255
What is wrong with...?

53:49.410 --> 53:51.670
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.

53:51.790 --> 53:54.890
It's one thing to say no.
It's another to offer a reason...

53:55.010 --> 53:56.614
How do we get that key?

54:02.978 --> 54:04.096
You're kidding!

54:05.156 --> 54:05.965
Really?

54:06.085 --> 54:07.168
Woody's back?

54:07.288 --> 54:08.023
Woody's back?

54:08.185 --> 54:10.073
And you're sure it's
Bo Peep who's with him?

54:11.694 --> 54:12.765
Thank you, Benson.

54:12.885 --> 54:14.323
Make sure the others are ready.

54:16.064 --> 54:17.174
Woody's back!

54:17.334 --> 54:19.410
I'm coming, Bonnie!

54:20.431 --> 54:21.209
Bonnie.

54:21.329 --> 54:23.414
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.

54:23.574 --> 54:24.134
Prepare?

54:24.254 --> 54:26.074
Have you ever played hide-and-seek?

54:26.257 --> 54:28.286
No. But it sounds complicated.

54:28.406 --> 54:29.245
It's easy.

54:29.365 --> 54:30.894
-I'll teach you, okay?
-Okay.

54:31.227 --> 54:32.454
The first thing you do is...

54:32.574 --> 54:34.675
one of us finds a place to hide...

54:34.795 --> 54:37.214
-Scary.
-...while the other one counts to ten...

54:37.374 --> 54:38.974
then tries to find them.

54:57.108 --> 54:58.478
What are we doing?

54:58.746 --> 55:01.848
Just stand there and be quiet!

55:06.479 --> 55:07.715
I'll do the talking.

55:09.494 --> 55:10.839
Hi, Tinny!

55:11.253 --> 55:13.456
Nice to see you, too.

55:14.294 --> 55:16.094
Yeah, he's with me.

55:16.294 --> 55:17.774
My friend? No, no, no.

55:17.934 --> 55:19.694
He's my accessory.

55:19.985 --> 55:21.654
-Hey, guys.
-Bo!

55:21.814 --> 55:23.671
Long time no see.

55:24.219 --> 55:25.374
Couldn't take it out there, huh?

55:25.534 --> 55:27.854
Hey, Doug. Saw your better half
at the front of the store.

55:28.014 --> 55:30.291
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.

55:30.411 --> 55:31.319
Bo came back!

55:31.439 --> 55:33.292
-Magic 8-Ball was right!
-Excuse me.

55:33.412 --> 55:34.955
-Sorry.
-What are you doing here?

55:35.075 --> 55:37.187
I thought the store
had no return policy!

55:37.307 --> 55:39.534
Bo, help me out.
I need a battery.

55:39.975 --> 55:42.454
We got to get this
wagon train a-movin'!

55:42.614 --> 55:44.142
-Agreed.
-Help, help, help.

55:44.262 --> 55:44.873
Cheater.

55:44.993 --> 55:46.334
Have you seen Duke?

55:46.494 --> 55:47.774
He's in the back.

55:56.287 --> 55:59.572
Look who jumped 40 school buses
and landed back into my life.

55:59.692 --> 56:01.562
-Hi, Duke!
-Who's the cowboy?

56:01.682 --> 56:03.647
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...

56:03.815 --> 56:06.850
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.

56:07.054 --> 56:08.254
Oh, yeah!

56:09.574 --> 56:10.418
Yes!

56:10.538 --> 56:12.094
He's posing.

56:12.992 --> 56:13.895
Duke?

56:14.015 --> 56:15.934
-Duke, we need to...
-Hold on. One more.

56:16.363 --> 56:18.531
Oh, yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?

56:18.716 --> 56:19.752
We need your help.

56:19.915 --> 56:22.970
Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep.

56:23.125 --> 56:26.328
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.

56:26.972 --> 56:29.892
What were you doing getting tangled up
with Gabby Gabby? You know better.

56:30.012 --> 56:32.368
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...

56:32.488 --> 56:33.831
to wander into the aisle.

56:33.951 --> 56:35.188
That doesn't make any sense.

56:35.308 --> 56:36.214
It doesn't, does it?

56:36.374 --> 56:38.911
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.

56:39.031 --> 56:41.186
That would have been a better route,
wouldn't it?

56:41.306 --> 56:43.241
Wow, this toy sounds
like a complete idiot.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.948
He does!

56:45.292 --> 56:47.018
Wait, are you that toy?

56:47.362 --> 56:48.746
So, here's the plan.

56:48.927 --> 56:51.494
We need to jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet.

56:51.614 --> 56:54.231
-And you are the toy to do it.
-No.

56:54.551 --> 56:55.384
-Duke.
-Nope.

56:55.504 --> 56:56.822
-Duke? Duke?
-No way!

56:56.942 --> 56:58.329
-Duke. Duke!
-Pass. Negative.

56:58.449 --> 56:59.636
-Duke.
-Rejected.

56:59.756 --> 57:02.831
Please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important. My kid...

57:02.991 --> 57:04.157
You have a kid?

57:05.928 --> 57:08.450
Hey, Duke, show us some more poses,
what do you say?

57:08.632 --> 57:10.351
-I had a kid.
-Oh, no.

57:10.714 --> 57:11.732
Rejean.

57:12.311 --> 57:15.751
Rejean was so excited
when he got me after Christmas.

57:16.265 --> 57:19.231
It was the happiest
Boxing Day of my life.

57:20.311 --> 57:23.835
That's Duke Caboom,
riding the amazing Caboom stunt cycle!

57:23.955 --> 57:25.311
Caboom!

57:25.991 --> 57:28.747
I was ready to finally do
what I was made to do.

57:28.933 --> 57:30.547
Caboom!

57:30.791 --> 57:34.431
But when Rejean realized I couldn't jump
as far as the toy in the commercial...

57:36.313 --> 57:38.511
It's a commercial!
It's not real!

57:38.671 --> 57:40.071
Rejean threw me away!

57:40.231 --> 57:41.391
It's not fair!

57:41.550 --> 57:43.431
Why, Rejean? Why?

57:45.071 --> 57:48.231
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.

57:48.431 --> 57:49.951
That was a long time ago.

57:50.551 --> 57:55.201
Right now, we need the only toy
who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet.

57:55.352 --> 57:55.911
Crash?

57:56.071 --> 57:56.911
Crash?

57:57.031 --> 57:59.111
Any Duke Caboom toy can land...

57:59.311 --> 58:03.071
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.

58:03.231 --> 58:04.880
-I am?
-Yes!

58:05.066 --> 58:07.351
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.

58:07.471 --> 58:09.551
Be the Duke you are right now...

58:09.947 --> 58:12.751
the one who jumps and crashes!

58:15.508 --> 58:20.080
Be who I am right now.

58:20.968 --> 58:23.240
Who's the Canuck with all the luck?

58:23.870 --> 58:24.672
Caboom?

58:24.792 --> 58:26.809
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?

58:26.929 --> 58:27.514
Caboom!

58:27.707 --> 58:31.187
Who's the most spectacular daredevil
Canada has ever seen?

58:31.353 --> 58:32.591
Duke Caboom!

58:33.216 --> 58:34.200
Can you do the jump?

58:34.379 --> 58:36.514
Yes, I Canada!

58:40.477 --> 58:41.863
-We've got our ride.
-Yes!

58:42.689 --> 58:44.350
Yee-haw!

58:44.631 --> 58:45.578
Yo, Bo!

58:45.698 --> 58:47.711
Gigs! You made it!

58:48.219 --> 58:49.261
Good work!

58:49.381 --> 58:50.471
How'd you get it?

58:50.984 --> 58:52.871
How do we get that key?

58:58.809 --> 58:59.791
-It was hard.
-Very difficult.

58:59.951 --> 59:01.829
-Barely made it out alive.
-Yeah.

59:01.949 --> 59:02.765
So, you're welcome.

59:03.157 --> 59:05.229
Okay. Let's do this.

59:05.631 --> 59:07.531
Let me wrap that up for you.

59:07.651 --> 59:10.231
Don't want anything to happen to it
on the way home.

59:10.351 --> 59:12.511
Good. That sale buys us some time.

59:13.631 --> 59:15.684
Wait for it.

59:17.255 --> 59:18.688
All right, let's go!

01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:02.563
So, how long were you in here?

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.441
I don't know.
Couple years.

01:00:04.622 --> 01:00:07.391
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:09.040
So, I left.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.108
Wow.

01:00:10.228 --> 01:00:12.678
You've handled this lost toy life
better than I could.

01:00:12.798 --> 01:00:14.191
Sheriff.

01:00:14.673 --> 01:00:16.151
You're selling yourself short.

01:00:18.354 --> 01:00:20.431
I think you'd make a great lost toy.

01:00:22.129 --> 01:00:25.318
You really don't think you'll
ever be in a kid's room again, huh?

01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:26.242
Nope.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:29.148
And now with the carnival traveling through,
it's our chance to hop a ride...

01:00:29.268 --> 01:00:31.462
-and leave town.
-You're leaving?

01:00:31.582 --> 01:00:32.301
Sure am.

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:34.862
You ever think about
getting out there, seeing the world?

01:00:34.982 --> 01:00:35.816
Without a kid?

01:00:36.517 --> 01:00:39.795
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.

01:00:39.955 --> 01:00:41.515
You'd be surprised.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.955
So, how'd you end up in this store
in the first place?

01:00:46.115 --> 01:00:48.475
Well, I saw your lamp in the window...

01:00:48.595 --> 01:00:52.278
and I thought maybe you were inside...

01:00:52.446 --> 01:00:54.155
and so I...

01:00:58.075 --> 01:00:59.235
Wow.

01:01:00.235 --> 01:01:01.475
Yeah.

01:01:02.035 --> 01:01:03.504
Will you look at that?

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:08.195
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

01:01:16.115 --> 01:01:19.115
That's gonna be quite a jump
for you and Duke.

01:01:20.656 --> 01:01:21.675
For me?

01:01:26.275 --> 01:01:27.978
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.

01:01:28.098 --> 01:01:29.250
I am?

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:30.871
Let's caboom.

01:01:30.991 --> 01:01:32.595
It'll be fine, Duke's the best.

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.625
Yeah, at crashing.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:39.888
And now!

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:43.069
Go!

01:01:52.153 --> 01:01:53.395
Rejean.

01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:56.115
It's a commercial.
It's not real!

01:01:56.275 --> 01:01:58.674
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!

01:01:58.829 --> 01:02:00.557
No, no, no!

01:02:09.164 --> 01:02:11.334
What's new, pussycat?

01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:23.352
-Forky?
-Girls?

01:02:23.472 --> 01:02:25.010
Forky, where are you?

01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.810
You're never gonna find me.

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:27.970
Forky?

01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:31.355
Woody!
How'd you find me?

01:02:31.475 --> 01:02:33.170
-Bo, I found him!
-Hi.

01:02:33.433 --> 01:02:35.930
Wait, it's an actual fork?

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:37.610
Bo! Bo! Bo!

01:02:37.863 --> 01:02:39.308
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!

01:02:39.428 --> 01:02:41.634
What?
Where'd they go?

01:02:43.499 --> 01:02:44.690
Okay, we can go now!

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:45.844
No. I need to find my girls.

01:02:45.964 --> 01:02:46.850
Hello, Woody.

01:02:47.495 --> 01:02:48.210
Hi, Bo.

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:49.487
-Where are my sheep?
-Yeah!

01:02:49.607 --> 01:02:51.090
Look! Woody found me!

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:53.290
Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!

01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:57.690
Oh, no, no!

01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:58.542
Woody!

01:02:58.662 --> 01:02:59.826
I just wanna talk.

01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:01.610
Yeah, with my voice box!

01:03:03.094 --> 01:03:04.050
Pull!

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.092
You're my favorite deputy.

01:03:09.461 --> 01:03:11.690
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:13.250
I'd like to join your posse.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:16.035
Reach for the sky!

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:28.410
Girls!

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.721
Drop it.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.250
No! No!
Forky!

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.965
-We've gotta go!
-Wait!

01:03:38.138 --> 01:03:39.118
Forky!

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:42.744
Woody!

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:57.050
Bonnie's backpack?

01:04:04.169 --> 01:04:05.010
Giggle!

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:08.905
Don't let Woody leave!

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:12.930
Grab on!

01:04:17.682 --> 01:04:19.223
Duke, get us out of here!

01:04:19.343 --> 01:04:20.250
Oui!

01:04:21.376 --> 01:04:22.948
Here, kitty, kitty!

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.896
Wait! We don't have Forky!

01:04:25.056 --> 01:04:26.336
Woody!

01:04:30.456 --> 01:04:31.296
Forky!

01:04:50.707 --> 01:04:52.056
Is everyone okay?

01:04:56.696 --> 01:04:57.696
It's okay.

01:04:58.489 --> 01:04:59.416
It's okay.

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:01.896
Bunny? Bunny?

01:05:02.845 --> 01:05:05.427
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.

01:05:05.582 --> 01:05:08.296
No, no, no, no.

01:05:10.176 --> 01:05:11.647
-Bunny!
-It's gonna be okay.

01:05:11.767 --> 01:05:12.976
Forky's still in there.

01:05:13.136 --> 01:05:14.376
If we hurry, we can get
him before they lock him up.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:15.796
You want us to go back in there?

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:17.117
We barely got out alive.

01:05:17.237 --> 01:05:18.616
-Woody, it's better if we wait.
-No, no, no.

01:05:18.776 --> 01:05:20.216
There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:22.616
-But I saw Bonnie's...
-By my count, there were only four dummies.

01:05:22.776 --> 01:05:24.376
-But the backpack...
-We outnumber them. So we have the advantage.

01:05:24.496 --> 01:05:26.209
Woody, look at us!

01:05:29.143 --> 01:05:31.885
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?

01:05:32.005 --> 01:05:34.456
No. No, no, no.
We are wasting time. We can do this.

01:05:34.616 --> 01:05:36.318
-Come on, Pull-string.
-It's not worth it.

01:05:36.438 --> 01:05:37.708
Yeah, yes, listen to her!

01:05:37.828 --> 01:05:39.586
-Nobody wants this!
-I do!

01:05:39.706 --> 01:05:40.821
-Why?
-Because!

01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:42.536
-Why?
-Just because!

01:05:42.696 --> 01:05:45.540
-Why?
-Because it's all I have left to do!

01:05:47.999 --> 01:05:49.576
I don't have anything else.

01:05:51.056 --> 01:05:52.996
So, the rest of us don't count?

01:05:53.776 --> 01:05:55.656
That's not what I meant.

01:05:55.989 --> 01:05:57.216
Bonnie needs Forky.

01:05:57.336 --> 01:05:59.689
No. You need Bonnie!

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:03.216
Open your eyes, Woody.
There's plenty of kids out there.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:07.416
It can't be just about the one
you're still clinging to.

01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:09.416
It's called loyalty.

01:06:09.536 --> 01:06:11.863
Something a lost
toy wouldn't understand.

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:21.456
I'm not the one who's lost.

01:06:22.974 --> 01:06:24.216
Let's get out of here.

01:06:24.653 --> 01:06:26.896
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.

01:06:27.202 --> 01:06:28.336
Come on.

01:06:30.006 --> 01:06:31.214
We'll find our own kid.

01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:32.455
You're crazy.

01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:36.634
Bo!

01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:39.776
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.

01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:48.976
Woody, you did all you could.

01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:50.392
Time to go home.

01:06:51.086 --> 01:06:52.166
No.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:52.988
Woody.

01:06:53.157 --> 01:06:54.606
I don't leave toys behind, Buzz.

01:06:54.756 --> 01:06:55.950
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:58.046
Not now. Not ever.

01:06:59.806 --> 01:07:01.646
And he left me behind.

01:07:03.046 --> 01:07:04.246
What now, inner voice?

01:07:04.522 --> 01:07:06.253
Mission accomplished. Return to base.

01:07:06.425 --> 01:07:08.563
Go back to the RV? What about Woody?

01:07:08.776 --> 01:07:10.562
We're going home, space ranger.

01:07:10.682 --> 01:07:11.681
Fall back, this planet...

01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:12.844
Retreat! There's too...

01:07:12.964 --> 01:07:15.006
Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run...

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:16.806
Get out! Returning to Star Command.

01:07:16.926 --> 01:07:19.178
Okay. Okay.

01:07:21.114 --> 01:07:22.686
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

01:07:24.038 --> 01:07:27.586
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.

01:07:27.848 --> 01:07:30.326
Okay. Then can we go to the carnival?

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:31.828
Sure.

01:07:37.623 --> 01:07:38.672
Hello, Woody.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.330
I knew you'd be back.

01:07:42.442 --> 01:07:43.646
You don't know me.

01:07:43.966 --> 01:07:45.366
But I do.

01:07:45.966 --> 01:07:48.966
You were left in the closet,
feeling useless...

01:07:49.712 --> 01:07:51.566
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

01:07:51.726 --> 01:07:53.526
I'm not leaving without Forky.

01:07:53.726 --> 01:07:56.048
Can we agree on just one thing?

01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:57.268
What?

01:07:57.388 --> 01:08:02.806
That being there for a child
is the most noble thing a toy can do.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.333
Okay.

01:08:07.726 --> 01:08:11.286
I was defective right out of the box.

01:08:11.446 --> 01:08:15.174
I can only imagine
what it must have been like for you.

01:08:15.953 --> 01:08:18.526
All that time you spent with Andy...

01:08:19.423 --> 01:08:22.766
riding a bike with
him for the first time...

01:08:23.745 --> 01:08:26.606
comforting him when
he skinned his knee...

01:08:27.086 --> 01:08:29.387
proudly watching him grow up.

01:08:30.446 --> 01:08:33.406
And then you got a second chance
with Bonnie...

01:08:33.566 --> 01:08:36.662
giving her comfort
when she's scared at school...

01:08:36.834 --> 01:08:39.408
helping her when she needs it most.

01:08:40.209 --> 01:08:43.726
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.

01:08:45.808 --> 01:08:47.206
Please.

01:08:47.366 --> 01:08:49.010
Be honest with me.

01:08:50.773 --> 01:08:53.246
Was it as wonderful as it sounds?

01:08:57.281 --> 01:08:59.388
It was.

01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:06.126
All I want is a chance
for just one of those moments.

01:09:08.606 --> 01:09:12.326
I'd give anything to be loved
the way you have.

01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:20.233
Just leave me Forky.

01:09:21.696 --> 01:09:23.166
Bonnie needs him.

01:09:24.731 --> 01:09:26.562
Of course.

01:09:38.372 --> 01:09:40.386
The flat tire is fixed!

01:09:40.506 --> 01:09:42.442
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

01:09:42.602 --> 01:09:44.242
Where is he?

01:09:44.967 --> 01:09:46.722
-Buzz!
-Buzz!

01:09:46.882 --> 01:09:48.202
-Where's Woody?
-And Forky?

01:09:48.362 --> 01:09:49.159
We have a situation.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.099
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.

01:09:51.298 --> 01:09:52.602
How do we do that?

01:09:52.762 --> 01:09:54.657
Okay, let's make
sure we have everything.

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:56.010
Finally.

01:09:56.194 --> 01:09:57.660
It's okay.
Any minute now...

01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.868
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.

01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:02.202
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...

01:10:02.322 --> 01:10:04.017
and we'll head back in there.

01:10:04.216 --> 01:10:05.875
Okay. Looks like we have everything.

01:10:05.995 --> 01:10:07.418
-You good, Bonnie?
-Yup.

01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:09.285
Great. Let's get out of here.

01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:12.504
Okay, genius, what do we do now?

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:15.040
Scanning perimeter.
Laser at full power!

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.362
-Buzz, what are you doing?
-I'm thinking.

01:10:17.562 --> 01:10:19.162
Honey, will you please
shut that toy off?

01:10:19.322 --> 01:10:20.162
Yeah, I got it.

01:10:20.322 --> 01:10:22.242
Attack! Meteor shower! Look out!

01:10:23.602 --> 01:10:24.962
It's a secret mission
in uncharted space! Let's go!

01:10:25.162 --> 01:10:27.402
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

01:10:27.574 --> 01:10:29.762
-Bonnie, how do you turn this off?
-Full speed ahead!

01:10:29.922 --> 01:10:31.653
-Open the pod bay doors!
-I don't know.

01:10:31.829 --> 01:10:33.265
It's just you and me now, cadet.

01:10:33.385 --> 01:10:34.642
A distress signal is coming
from that rocket.

01:10:34.802 --> 01:10:36.172
Just toss it in the drawer.

01:10:36.402 --> 01:10:39.387
To infinity and beyond!

01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:41.531
Your backpack's in the antique store!
Let's go!

01:10:41.651 --> 01:10:43.578
Oh, no, my backpack!

01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:46.802
I left my backpack
in the antique store!

01:10:46.962 --> 01:10:47.614
You did?

01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:51.042
All right, let's swing by and get it.

01:10:56.882 --> 01:11:00.442
I can't believe the nerve of that cowboy.
I mean, who does he think he is?

01:11:00.842 --> 01:11:03.482
Exactly!
He was way out of line.

01:11:03.642 --> 01:11:05.322
You did the right
thing leaving him behind.

01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:08.202
Hey, Lamb Chops?

01:11:08.322 --> 01:11:09.981
Coast is clear.

01:11:15.687 --> 01:11:16.569
Head to the middle.

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:19.822
When the carnival leaves tomorrow,
we'll hide right there.

01:11:21.623 --> 01:11:22.982
-No way!
-Stuff that.

01:11:23.102 --> 01:11:23.802
Awesome.

01:11:23.962 --> 01:11:25.278
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.

01:11:25.398 --> 01:11:26.546
-Ready?
-No!

01:11:26.666 --> 01:11:28.442
And another thing,
Woody asked you for help.

01:11:28.562 --> 01:11:30.240
-On your mark...
-And he treats you like that?

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.498
-...get set...
-He only cares about himself.

01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:33.442
No!

01:11:33.562 --> 01:11:34.602
You're wrong.

01:11:34.762 --> 01:11:36.392
Woody's always trying to do right
by his kid.

01:11:36.512 --> 01:11:38.764
By putting everyone in danger.

01:11:38.884 --> 01:11:40.842
That kind of crazy loyalty just...

01:11:41.002 --> 01:11:42.282
You gotta love him for it.

01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:43.762
Whoa, say what now?

01:11:43.922 --> 01:11:46.373
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?

01:11:46.493 --> 01:11:48.120
Fill me in here.

01:11:53.077 --> 01:11:54.637
Get in!
We're going back.

01:11:54.757 --> 01:11:55.655
We just got here.

01:11:55.775 --> 01:11:57.362
You heard Bo!
We're going back!

01:11:57.534 --> 01:12:00.005
Move your plush! Let's ride!

01:12:06.484 --> 01:12:08.634
You're my favorite...

01:12:21.912 --> 01:12:23.266
Yay!

01:12:24.844 --> 01:12:27.892
You are my best friend.
Let's play all day!

01:12:28.047 --> 01:12:29.659
Benson!
Did you hear that?

01:12:29.818 --> 01:12:30.941
Isn't that lovely?

01:12:31.061 --> 01:12:32.185
Time for tea.

01:12:32.305 --> 01:12:34.793
Thank you, Woody.
Thank you!

01:12:34.987 --> 01:12:37.012
All my dreams are coming true
because of you.

01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:38.267
Thank you! Thank you!

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:39.853
You're welcome.

01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:42.608
It's time, Benson.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.897
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks.

01:12:46.017 --> 01:12:48.313
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.

01:12:48.433 --> 01:12:50.462
Thank you, my little utensil.

01:12:51.828 --> 01:12:54.602
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!

01:12:55.259 --> 01:12:57.744
He is terrifying.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.436
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:01.387
Bonnie?

01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:02.549
Can I help you with anything?

01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:03.782
Yeah. We called about the backpack.

01:13:03.902 --> 01:13:05.837
Yes.
I couldn't find it.

01:13:06.362 --> 01:13:07.362
Feel free to look around.

01:13:07.482 --> 01:13:09.162
Quick! Before she finds it!

01:13:12.567 --> 01:13:15.284
Look! There's Harmony.

01:13:17.438 --> 01:13:20.880
You make me so happy!
Let's be best friends.

01:13:21.257 --> 01:13:22.758
This is it!

01:13:23.138 --> 01:13:24.678
We're going home, Forky!

01:13:27.498 --> 01:13:28.438
Forky!

01:13:30.137 --> 01:13:33.093
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!

01:13:39.079 --> 01:13:41.398
I'm Gabby Gabby, and I love you.

01:13:43.277 --> 01:13:44.758
I'm gonna cry.

01:13:48.846 --> 01:13:50.238
What have you got there?

01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:52.380
I found this old doll.

01:13:53.071 --> 01:13:55.724
You can take it home if you want.

01:13:57.054 --> 01:13:58.404
Nah.

01:14:05.878 --> 01:14:08.539
What happened?
Gabby was supposed to be her toy.

01:14:08.659 --> 01:14:09.868
There's my backpack!

01:14:10.277 --> 01:14:11.658
Mom, it's over here.

01:14:16.716 --> 01:14:17.885
Forky!

01:14:18.005 --> 01:14:19.729
Mom, I found him!

01:14:19.849 --> 01:14:21.058
There he is!

01:14:21.278 --> 01:14:24.681
Now, please leave him in there,
so he doesn't get lost again.

01:14:31.593 --> 01:14:33.071
But what about Gabby?

01:14:34.565 --> 01:14:36.225
Forky, listen to me very carefully.

01:14:36.345 --> 01:14:37.318
This is important.

01:14:37.438 --> 01:14:40.166
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.

01:14:40.354 --> 01:14:41.038
You understand?

01:14:41.158 --> 01:14:43.562
Absolutely. What is a merry-go-round?

01:14:43.782 --> 01:14:45.958
The spinny ride with
lights and horses.

01:14:46.118 --> 01:14:47.839
-You mean a carousel.
-Yes!

01:14:48.291 --> 01:14:50.106
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.

01:14:50.226 --> 01:14:51.226
Got it.

01:15:04.516 --> 01:15:06.876
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

01:15:07.685 --> 01:15:09.836
You can have your voice box back.

01:15:11.585 --> 01:15:13.186
I don't need it anymore.

01:15:13.306 --> 01:15:14.342
Oh, yes, you do.

01:15:14.462 --> 01:15:17.596
Harmony wasn't your only chance,
Gabby, but we have to hurry. Come on.

01:15:17.756 --> 01:15:21.116
No. Harmony was my chance.

01:15:21.996 --> 01:15:23.992
My time's over.

01:15:24.112 --> 01:15:26.196
Now, please go away.

01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:39.691
You hear that?

01:15:45.996 --> 01:15:47.876
A friend once told me...

01:15:48.075 --> 01:15:50.402
"There are plenty of kids out there."

01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:54.116
And one of them is named Bonnie.

01:15:55.956 --> 01:15:58.849
She's waiting for you, right now.

01:15:59.796 --> 01:16:01.636
She just doesn't know it yet.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.516
What if you're wrong?

01:16:08.442 --> 01:16:10.273
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...

01:16:10.393 --> 01:16:12.236
you'll never find out, will you?

01:16:15.956 --> 01:16:17.196
He's right.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.916
I learned that from the best.

01:16:24.156 --> 01:16:26.316
Come on, Gabby.

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:28.116
Let's get you to Bonnie.

01:16:34.876 --> 01:16:35.688
The carousel?

01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:38.556
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.

01:16:38.676 --> 01:16:40.316
Woody said to meet him there.

01:16:40.516 --> 01:16:42.596
-You gotta be kidding!
-How do we do that?

01:16:42.756 --> 01:16:43.201
We could...

01:16:43.321 --> 01:16:44.717
We are not sending Dad to jail.

01:16:44.837 --> 01:16:45.905
You're no fun.

01:16:46.072 --> 01:16:48.956
Left turn in 0.5 miles.

01:16:49.116 --> 01:16:51.796
Wait a second. I have an idea.

01:17:02.773 --> 01:17:04.036
Skunk!

01:17:04.276 --> 01:17:05.723
Skunk!

01:17:16.009 --> 01:17:18.302
Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route.

01:17:18.422 --> 01:17:20.772
Will we make it to
the carousel in time?

01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:26.276
Yes, we Canada!

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:27.716
What? What is it?

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:37.036
Recalculating. Take a right.

01:17:37.196 --> 01:17:38.316
What? A right?

01:17:38.516 --> 01:17:40.397
Right turn ahead.

01:17:40.716 --> 01:17:42.036
Does the GPS sound funny to you?

01:17:42.196 --> 01:17:43.836
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.

01:17:44.476 --> 01:17:45.716
I thought it sounded funny.

01:17:49.147 --> 01:17:49.932
Another right!

01:17:50.104 --> 01:17:52.281
-Right.
-Take another right.

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:53.858
Another right? Really?

01:17:53.978 --> 01:17:56.434
-Turn right!
-Now! Turn right!

01:17:58.276 --> 01:18:00.556
-We're headin' back.
-There's the carousel!

01:18:00.749 --> 01:18:02.958
Do you think Woody
will get there in time?

01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:05.896
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.

01:18:06.016 --> 01:18:07.676
-No dice. Rejected.
-Duke, Duke, you got this.

01:18:07.836 --> 01:18:09.516
This is the fastest
way to the carousel.

01:18:09.676 --> 01:18:10.796
You made the last jump.

01:18:10.956 --> 01:18:12.956
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!

01:18:13.116 --> 01:18:16.356
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.

01:18:16.556 --> 01:18:18.572
-No. He'd never do that.
-No, no, no.

01:18:18.692 --> 01:18:23.556
He's the toy that went on to crash
40 feet into that target!

01:18:23.716 --> 01:18:25.676
Yeah, he is.

01:18:26.006 --> 01:18:27.316
I'm Duke Caboom!

01:18:27.516 --> 01:18:29.196
Oh, man. I can do this!

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:30.596
Yes, you Canada!

01:18:30.756 --> 01:18:32.868
-I can do it with my eyes closed.
-Yes, you... What?

01:18:32.988 --> 01:18:35.206
-Three, two, one. Go!
-What? No, wait!

01:18:40.881 --> 01:18:42.666
-What is he doing?
-Oh, no.

01:18:53.315 --> 01:18:55.396
This is for you, Rejean.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.322
Caboom.

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:06.692
Yes!

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:07.796
He did it!

01:19:07.956 --> 01:19:08.956
All right, our turn!

01:19:09.116 --> 01:19:11.036
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.

01:19:16.983 --> 01:19:18.375
Yee-haw!

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:22.276
Another right!

01:19:22.476 --> 01:19:24.392
Another right?
That's the wrong way.

01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:26.408
-Are you sure?
-Stupid rental.

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:27.756
-I'm turning us around.
-No!

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.483
Recalculating. Turn right.

01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:33.298
-Must be broken.
-No! No!

01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:39.516
-What is happening?
-Honey, what are you doing? Slow down!

01:19:39.676 --> 01:19:41.063
I can't! I can't!

01:19:41.316 --> 01:19:43.396
-Press the brake. Press it!
-I'm trying.

01:19:50.205 --> 01:19:53.069
Got a visual on the RV,
heading southbound.

01:19:59.362 --> 01:20:00.544
Gabby?

01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:04.123
Gabby?

01:20:07.379 --> 01:20:09.211
I think she's lost.

01:20:24.665 --> 01:20:26.724
Are you sure?

01:20:36.716 --> 01:20:38.591
Change of plans.

01:20:43.316 --> 01:20:44.916
Pull over.

01:20:45.476 --> 01:20:47.498
I can't! This is a rental!

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:49.530
I don't know what's happening!

01:20:59.782 --> 01:21:01.293
I'm so nervous.

01:21:01.789 --> 01:21:03.791
What if she doesn't like me?

01:21:03.911 --> 01:21:05.846
-Gabby.
-I don't know if I can do this.

01:21:06.376 --> 01:21:08.231
Gabby, it's just like you said.

01:21:08.351 --> 01:21:11.441
This is the most noble
thing a toy can do.

01:21:16.143 --> 01:21:17.003
Okay.

01:21:17.191 --> 01:21:20.603
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.

01:21:23.097 --> 01:21:24.755
Not too far.

01:21:24.992 --> 01:21:27.275
That's it.

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:29.323
Perfect.

01:21:30.257 --> 01:21:32.808
-Winner, winner...
-Chicken dinner.

01:21:54.537 --> 01:21:57.149
Are you lost, too?

01:22:00.424 --> 01:22:03.707
I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:06.089
I'll help you.

01:22:13.214 --> 01:22:16.355
Excuse me, can you help us?

01:22:16.475 --> 01:22:18.145
Honey, what's wrong?

01:22:18.353 --> 01:22:19.751
I can't find my mom and dad.

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.540
It's okay. I'll help you find them.

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.097
I'm sure they're not far.

01:22:23.476 --> 01:22:24.245
She was right next to us.

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:25.337
She was right here!

01:22:25.457 --> 01:22:26.874
And I looked away for one second.

01:22:26.994 --> 01:22:28.481
Mommy!

01:22:36.617 --> 01:22:37.789
I couldn't find you...

01:22:37.998 --> 01:22:39.337
and then I found this doll.

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:40.497
You did?

01:22:40.697 --> 01:22:42.476
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

01:22:55.256 --> 01:22:56.857
We actually did that.

01:22:57.297 --> 01:22:59.537
Oh, yeah. Yes!

01:22:59.737 --> 01:23:01.417
That was amazing.

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:03.457
We make a great team, guys.

01:23:05.595 --> 01:23:07.897
Pull over now!

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:12.064
Almost there.

01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:14.674
-Stop!
-Stop!

01:23:19.474 --> 01:23:20.946
Are we home?

01:23:24.518 --> 01:23:27.015
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:29.860
Dad's totally going to jail.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.663
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.

01:23:37.867 --> 01:23:40.328
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.

01:23:40.908 --> 01:23:42.133
For me?

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.217
Have a good night.

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:47.631
What the...?

01:23:49.131 --> 01:23:50.897
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:24:05.801 --> 01:24:06.677
Hey.

01:24:08.966 --> 01:24:10.137
So long, cowboy.

01:24:10.637 --> 01:24:12.282
Happy trails.

01:24:16.338 --> 01:24:21.136
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.

01:24:27.864 --> 01:24:29.897
I'm glad I got to see you again.

01:24:31.944 --> 01:24:33.464
I don't...

01:24:59.817 --> 01:25:01.057
Goodbye, Bo.

01:25:26.017 --> 01:25:27.937
Buzz, I...

01:25:30.252 --> 01:25:31.948
She'll be okay.

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:37.607
Bonnie will be okay.

01:25:43.954 --> 01:25:44.977
You sure?

01:25:45.097 --> 01:25:48.034
Hey. Listen to your inner voice.

01:26:18.105 --> 01:26:18.745
Bo?

01:26:18.943 --> 01:26:21.897
-Is it really her?
-I'll be danged, it's Bo!

01:26:22.361 --> 01:26:23.603
Jessie.

01:26:24.544 --> 01:26:26.080
Bo!

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.580
So long, Forky.

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.524
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?

01:27:35.055 --> 01:27:37.526
-Go, go, go!
-Oh, boy.

01:27:38.372 --> 01:27:40.656
Oh, my goodness. The awning.
What is going on?

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:17.540
Does this mean Woody's a lost toy?

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.211
He's not lost.

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.060
Not anymore.

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.754
To infinity...

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.719
And beyond.

01:29:27.712 --> 01:29:29.090
There goes another one.

01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:30.971
We're never getting outta here.

01:29:31.091 --> 01:29:32.020
Frog legs.

01:29:32.208 --> 01:29:33.380
Up here, Rainbow Connection.

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:36.060
You Mr. Toads wanna take a wild ride
with a kid?

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.220
We can make that happen.

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.424
-You can?
-Really?

01:29:38.544 --> 01:29:41.030
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.140
All right. Nice job, gang!

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.620
Every prize with a kid.

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.255
-What's next?
-Leave that to us.

01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:29.860
We know exactly what to do.

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.512
Plush Rush!

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.300
How you like that, huh?

01:31:11.694 --> 01:31:13.098
You got plush-rushed, son!

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.580
Dance!

01:31:16.027 --> 01:31:17.988
Dance! Get those knees up!

01:31:19.809 --> 01:31:21.818
Let's see those feet move!

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.184
Or we can get more toys
to kids.

01:31:36.304 --> 01:31:38.143
Yeah, let's do that.

01:31:40.007 --> 01:31:43.105
Do you really have laser eyes?

01:31:44.507 --> 01:31:46.186
Yeah.

01:32:14.522 --> 01:32:16.504
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

01:32:17.559 --> 01:32:18.453
Jessie's back!

01:32:18.573 --> 01:32:20.220
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.672
-Well, it was...
-How was "Present and Explain"?

01:32:22.792 --> 01:32:24.571
You mean "Show and Tell" there,
big guy.

01:32:24.691 --> 01:32:25.903
You see any kids eat paste?

01:32:26.023 --> 01:32:27.112
Guys, listen!

01:32:27.232 --> 01:32:29.574
Bonnie had a great day in first grade.

01:32:29.694 --> 01:32:31.835
She even made a new friend in class.

01:32:32.435 --> 01:32:33.993
She's already making friends.

01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:36.955
No, no, she made a new friend.

01:32:37.379 --> 01:32:40.174
Come on out, it's okay.

01:32:58.195 --> 01:33:01.595
Hi. I'm Forky.

01:33:02.847 --> 01:33:03.586
Trash?

01:33:03.706 --> 01:33:06.875
No, no. Toy.
I am a...

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:09.475
We are all toys.

01:33:09.595 --> 01:33:13.408
Unique, beautiful toys.

01:33:13.715 --> 01:33:16.995
I will explain everything.

01:33:17.795 --> 01:33:22.426
How am I alive?

01:33:24.282 --> 01:33:26.776
I don't know.

01:33:41.555 --> 01:33:46.531
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:33:47.195 --> 01:33:50.315
Lonesome as I could be

01:33:51.195 --> 01:33:55.155
You came along and changed my life

01:33:55.715 --> 01:33:58.795
And fixed what was broken in me

01:34:00.235 --> 01:34:05.075
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:34:06.295 --> 01:34:08.940
I didn't have a friend

01:34:09.755 --> 01:34:13.653
Now I got friends
coming out of my ears

01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:17.977
I'll never be lonesome again

01:34:18.638 --> 01:34:22.948
You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself

01:34:23.068 --> 01:34:25.475
Go on, tell me I'm wrong

01:34:25.635 --> 01:34:26.995
You're wrong

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:31.315
When someone takes you
down from the shelf

01:34:31.597 --> 01:34:34.795
And plays with you some
It's wonderful

01:34:35.028 --> 01:34:36.195
Wonderful

01:34:36.355 --> 01:34:41.068
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:34:42.498 --> 01:34:44.755
But not anymore

01:34:46.007 --> 01:34:49.915
I just found out
What love is about

01:34:50.161 --> 01:34:53.542
I've never felt this way before

01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:58.035
I was a lonesome cowboy

01:35:00.188 --> 01:35:04.755
But not anymore

01:39:53.865 --> 01:39:54.987
Caboom!

01:39:56.583 --> 01:39:57.864
Yes!
